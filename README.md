# Grupi45-app

This C++ program allows the user to input a number of grades and then displays them on the screen.
It uses a vector to store the grades and a separate function to handle user input.

The program demonstrates:
Using vector from the C++ Standard Library
Passing vectors by reference to functions
Basic input/output with cin and cout
Looping through a vector using a range-based for loop

How It Works
The program asks the user how many grades they want to enter.
The function lexoNotat reads the grades from the user and stores them in a vector.
After all grades are entered, the program prints them to the console.
